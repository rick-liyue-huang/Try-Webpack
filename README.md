## webpack5 demo

In this project, I research webpack5 and realize the different bundle status under directories, including build-base-conf, build-multi-page, build-splitChunks and so on. Under each condition, I will use the demo coding in 'oldsrc' directory to display target coding structure in dist directory. In the end, I create complete webpack.config.js file to bundle the typescript react web app in src directory
